# ML-Algorithms-Implementation

## Description

This repository contains implementations of classical machine learning algorithms. The implementations are categorized as follows:
- **From Scratch**: Algorithms implemented using NumPy, based on lab sessions for the IE 7300 Statistical Learning for Engineering course.
- **Using Scikit-Learn**: Algorithms implemented using the scikit-learn library, for practice and exploration of various machine learning techniques and applications.

## Repository Structure

- **data**: Contains datasets used for the implementations.
- **notebooks**
  - **from-scratch**: Jupyter notebooks with algorithms implemented from scratch using NumPy.
  - **scikit-learn**: Jupyter notebooks with algorithms implemented using the scikit-learn library.
